## Description

  This project involves building an API for a social network web application. Users can interact with the API to share their thoughts, react to their friends' thoughts, and manage their friend lists. The application utilizes Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database for data storage, and the Mongoose ODM (Object Data Modeling) for database interaction. Timestamps are formatted using JavaScript's Date object or an optional JavaScript date library.
